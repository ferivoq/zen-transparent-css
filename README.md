# Zen Transparent CSS

A collection of my custom CSS modifications that make various websites transparent for the Zen Browser.

## Supported Sites

Currently, the following sites have custom transparent styles:

- [**ncore.pro**](ncore.pro/styles.css) (READ THE MD!)
- [**google.com**](google.com/styles.css)
- [**nyaa.si**](nyaa.si/styles.css)
- [**youtube.com**](youtube.com/styles.css)

Each site has its own `styles.css` file located in a folder named after the site.
